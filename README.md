## FPH Headtracker for RC Airplanes

The FPH Headtracker is an advanced device designed for RC airplane enthusiasts. It enables pilots to control the camera on their RC aircraft by simply moving their head. This immersive technology enhances the flying experience by providing a first-person view (FPV) that moves naturally with the pilot's head movements. The headtracker system is equipped with sensors that accurately track the pilot's head position and transmit these movements to the camera gimbal on the RC airplane, allowing for precise and intuitive control. This innovation is particularly useful for aerial photography, racing, and immersive flight simulations, making the flying experience more engaging and realistic.
